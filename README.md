# Introduction
This is the Maginus Lunch Project.

This project is a lunch ordering application for Maginus Employees as "free"
Lunch forms a part of the Maginus Employee Benefits (free when ordered via this Application).

It is also an exploration of a new (to Maginus) way of constructing Internet Scale
Distributed Applications featuring:
- CQRS
- Event Sourcing
- ASP.Net Core
- Semantic Logging
- Cloud-based Application Monitoring and Telemetry
- Behavioural APIs
- Cloud-based deployment to highly available, scaleable (up and down) PAAS
- Interchangeable Software Architecture with plug replacement platform services (e.g. persistence, caching, IOC, PAAS)
- Multi-factor Authentication
- Authentication and Authorization as a Service

Enjoy
Luv
